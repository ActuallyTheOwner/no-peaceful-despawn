This mod does NOT allow peaceful mobs to spawn in outside of spawners.
This mod is to prevent despawning of minecraft mobs from the peaceful toggle and may be used with other mods.
report bugs to https://github.com/skycatminepokie/no-peaceful-despawn/issues

Please use the command /doPeacefulMobSpawners as an operator to allow mob spawners and silverfish to function for monsters in peaceful.
Infested blocks count as spawners in this case.

Thank you as of August 3rd 2025
